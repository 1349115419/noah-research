# BERT_CoQA
BERT_CoQA is an analysis toolkit for testing pretrained language models on specific compositional and lexical semantics features applied to the CoQA datase. And we also provide a set of explicit features which can be easily integrated during finetuning of pretrained language models applied to conversational Question Answering.
